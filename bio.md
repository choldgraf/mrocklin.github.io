I grew up in San Juan Capistrano, a town by the beach in Southern California,
and was fortunate to be raised by two loving parents, alongside two sisters.

### Academic

I attended university at UC Berkeley as a Physics/Math/Astronomy student.
After working for a bit I then joined the Computer Science department
at the University of Chicago as a PhD student from 2008-2013 where I was
advised by Todd Dupont and Ridg Scott.

After a brief stint at Sandia National Labs I joined Anaconda,
a for-profit company behind the open source numeric Python ecosystem where I
worked on many projects, but mostly [Dask](https://dask.org), a library for
parallel computing in Python.
Then, after five years at Anaconda I moved to NVIDIA, where I lead a team of
developers working on Dask, and enabling accelerated computing within Python
more generally.


### Personal

I moderate my work life with physical activity, primarily cycling and rock
climbing, and with slow hobbies, primarily amateur wood working and fiction.
