I grew up in San Juan Capistrano, a town by the beach in Southern California,
and was fortunate to be raised by two loving parents, alongside two sisters.

I now live in Brooklyn, New York.

### Academic

I attended university at UC Berkeley as a Physics/Math/Astronmy student.  I
worked at a local engineering firm while in university and for the Physics
department shortly after graduation.  I joined the Computer Science department
at the University of Chicago as a PhD student from 2008-2013 where I was
advised by Todd Dupont and Ridg Scott.

After a brief stint at Sandia National Labs I joined Continuum Analytics, a
for-profit company behind the open source numeric Python ecosystem.  I am still
at Continuum, working primarily on the Blaze project.


### Personal

I moderate my work life with physical activity, primarily cycling and rock
climbing, and with slow hobbies, primarily amateur wood working and fiction.
