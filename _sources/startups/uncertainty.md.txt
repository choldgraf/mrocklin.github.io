# Uncertainty

Uncertainty in work is uncomfortable.
We want to know that what we're working on will succeed,
otherwise we feel like fools for wasting our time.

And yet, most startups fail!  We're probably wasting our time!  Oof.  That's
hard.

As a company leader people often tell me that I need to reassure people and
tell them that we'll be successful.  I find this action to be unnatural and
unsettling.  I'm not Steve Jobs or Elon Musk.  Don't get me wrong, I have a
healthy ego and I think that we're well positioned for success, but the
engineer in me can't get comfortable skipping over the nuance and failure modes
out there.

I feel an obligation to surface failure and sit in the discomfort that it
presents.  I invite everyone else into that discomfort with me.


## We all face this

If you work in a startup then you need to be ok with the possibility
(probability) of failure.  It's balanced out by the possibility of having a
dramatic impact on the world.  Startups are high-risk, high reward.  It's
exciting but uncomfortable.  Not everyone is built for it.  To be honest, I'm
not sure that *I'm* built for it.

This occurs everywhere though, not just the uncertainty of failure, but the
uncertainty and ambiguity of having a plan.


## Seniority and ambiguity are linked

As I write in [an article on senior engineers](../engineering/senior-engineer),
I judge someone's seniority by the vagueness of a directive and plan that
they can be given and still execute well:

-  **Junior engineer**: accelerate workflow X by replacing algorithm Y with
   algorithm Z.  Here is a link to a reference that you can use. **(not at all
   vague)**

-  **Senior engineer**: these workflows seem to be taking a while and are costing
   us non-trivial money.  Can you see what can be done to accelerate them with
   the goal of saving us money?  **(kinda vague)**

-  **CTO:** make a good product, soon, without burning so much cost **(very
   vague)**

-  **CEO**: make a profitable company

To be clear, anyone can accept a vague directive.  The real question is if they
can deliver well on that vague directive, filling in all of the ambiguities
with their own planning, and with a willingness to observe, acknowledge
bad choices, learn, and redirect efforts.

## Startups are full of uncertainty and ambiguity

The people that I've seen thrive in startups are ok with uncertainty and ok
with ambiguity.  They acknowledge that they don't know exactly how to solve a
problem, but they're ok with giving it a shot and learning rapidly along the
way without getting too stressed out.
