Offsites
========

I love remote work, but it sucks for some things.
Occasional offsites focused around difficult problems can be great.  They promote alignment, can be used to solve hard problems, and generally reduce emotional stress throughout the company.

This article discusses tips on how to run an offsite.


Small and Focused
-----------------

Some companies have offsites for the entire company to congregate at once.
This enables broad social connections across everyone in the company.

I prefer offsites that bring together a small group of people to solve a
specific and important problem for the company.  This group ideally comes from
many different teams.  The problem is ideally something that everyone finds
painful and wants to fix.

Offsites provide social bonding, but I find the experience is more meaningful
when you solve a real problem.

Also, if offsites are smaller then you can have many more of them, and can use
them to respond to emergent issues on an as-needed basis.


Beautiful Venue
---------------

The team is undergoing hardship to travel to a remote location.  It's the
company's responsibility to provide a beautiful and engaging venue to
compensate for the difficulty.

I prefer large organic spaces, like renting out a large house by a lake or ocean.  I also prefer cooking group meals rather than going out to
restaurants.


Solicit Ideas Ahead of Time
---------------------------

People will want to voice concerns that they have on a topic.  Ideally they can
voice these concerns asynchronously ahead of time, such as on a shared Google
Document.  This probably makes sense to send out a week ahead of time.  The
leader should engage on this document in comments and keep the conversation
going.

People need to voice their experiences and opinions.  It's better that they do
so asynchronously (cheap) rather than in a large group in-person meeting
(expensive).

These ideas can also be sourced from the entire company, rather than just from
the group that is attending.  Ideally as much conversation happens on this doc
as possible ahead of the event.


Schedule
--------

Typically people fly in one day, we have a dinner that day for people who
arrive early enough.  Then folks work for two full days, and then the
following morning allowing people to fly off that afternoon (or stay the extra
day in the beautiful location).


Daily Cycle
-----------

For me offsites are about getting a group to iterate quickly on a larger topic.
Tactically, I do this with the following process:

1.  Get together as a large group for 20 minutes for a broad conversation

2.  Based on that conversation the leader breaks up the group into smaller
    teams (or individuals) to work for a couple of hours on some component

3.  The group gets back together to share what happened.  The team
    assesses the work, identifies issues, and then we redirect efforts

4.  Repeat ...

Doing this well requires significant direction from an offsite leader.
In particular I find that the leader needs to do two things to fight against
organic-but-ineffective behaviors:

1.  Limit large group conversations

    People naturally congregate into larger and larger groups.  They feel
    productive listening in on a large conversation, but this means that
    they're only exploring one thread rather than several.  The offsite leader
    should let these groups persist for a few minutes, but break them up
    after letting people briefly share some ideas

2.  Try, assess, and stop work threads

    When you split up after a large group meeting people are going to go off
    and try lots of different things.  Only some of these will be good
    directions.  This is ok (you are exploring) but it's important to redirect
    people quickly.

    If it seems like everyone has been on the right track the entire time then
    probably something is wrong.


Break
-----

It's a normal workday.  People should get in around 9-10am and be done around
5-6pm.  Then they get to socialize more.  It's totally ok to not be working all
the time.

Buy nice beer and wine and whiskey.  Everything is free relative to employee
time.


Invite Visitors
---------------

Investors or collaborators in the area may want to join for a time.  I'd
encourage you to start the first day with just the team, but adding people over
time can be energizing.
