We increasingly find that computational and programming concerns limit progress
more than do challenges within application domain itself.  I work to correct
this imbalance through a combination of academic research, open source software
development, and teaching.


### Current Research

My current work at Sandia National Labs is on algorithmic development in large
complex networks.


### General Research

I am broadly interested in *mathematical software engineering*.  That is I
study and improve how mathematicians and domain scientists develop and
distribute software.  My goal is not to solve any particular single problem but
rather to isolate and automate many of the decisions experts make in developing
a solution.


### Software Development

I write code.  I also think about how we write code as a community.  My work is
usually [open source](http://github.com/mrocklin) and my recent workflow and
thoughts are frequently [published online](/blog/).


### Background

My background is in physics and engineering. Historically I have been
interested in structured light scanning astronomy, and gravitation.

### Teaching

There exists an imbalance between computer science and the physical,
life, and social sciences. The maturity of solutions in computer science
has outpaced the knowledge of computational methods in these domains.
This is despite their relevance in today's dominant issues.

Because of this imbalance I prefer to teach methods courses in technical
fields outside of computer science. While at UChicago I traditionally served as
lab instructor for
[CMSC-12100](http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/courses/description/CMSC/12100/9999-12-31%2000:00:00.00).
and lectured a [similar course](http://matthewrocklin.com/cmsc15200) during the
Summer.
