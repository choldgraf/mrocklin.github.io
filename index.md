Programming often limits research more than fundamental domain challenges.<br>
I work to correct this imbalance through academic research, software
development, and teaching.


### Research

I study how domain scientists develop and distribute software.  My goal is not
to solve any particular problem but rather to isolate, automate, and distribute
the decisions experts make in developing solutions.

I focus on the domains of numerics, complex networks, and computer algebra as
well as general data analytics.  I automate through compilers and the
construction of domain specific languages.


### Software Development

I contribute within the numeric Python ecosystem. I also maintain a few
functional programming libraries. My work is usually [open
source](http://github.com/mrocklin) and my recent workflow and thoughts are
frequently [published online](/blog/).


### Teaching

There exists an imbalance between computer science and the physical,
life, and social sciences. The maturity of solutions in computer science
has outpaced the knowledge of computational methods in these domains.
This is despite their relevance in todays dominant issues.

Because of this imbalance I prefer to teach methods courses in technical
fields outside of computer science. While at UChicago I traditionally served as
lab instructor for
[CMSC-12100](http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/courses/description/CMSC/12100/9999-12-31%2000:00:00.00).
and lectured a [similar course](http://matthewrocklin.com/cmsc15200) during the
Summer.
