### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in scientific computing. I have a favorite
problem which I use to generate thoughts on automation. I think about
the domain problem of

-   Numerical methods for uncertainty propagation in dynamical systems

and attempt to solve it in an automated and high level way. My goal is
not to solve this single problem but rather to isolate and automate many
of the decisions experts make in developing a solution. Specifically I
think about how to automatically

-   Simplify and compile linear algebraic expressions
-   Statically schedule array expressions onto heterogeneous
    architectures
-   Expose simple and expressive programming interfaces suitable to
    mathematical users

More broadly I am interested in non-linear dynamics, numerical linear
algebra, automated high performance computation, and complex systems.

I also do work finding structure in large real-world complex networks.
This is completely separate from my scientific computing work.

My background is in physics and engineering. Historically I have been
interested in [structured light
scanning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured-light_3D_scanner),
astronomy, and gravitation.

### Teaching Philosophy

There exists an imbalance between computer science and the physical,
life, and social sciences. The maturity of solutions in computer science
has outpaced the knowledge of computational methods in these domains.
This is despite their relevance in today's dominant issues.

Because of this imbalance I prefer to teach methods courses in technical
fields outside of computer science. I traditionally serve as lab
instructor for
[CMSC-12100](http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/courses/description/CMSC/12100/9999-12-31%2000:00:00.00).
I lecture a [similar course](http://matthewrocklin.com/cmsc15200) during
the Summer.

### Personal Interests

I'm fond of the outdoors. I enjoy cycling, hiking, and rock climbing. I
also participate in a [weekly Ultimate Frisbee game here in Hyde
Park](http://mrocklin.github.com/hpfrisbee), all are welcome.
