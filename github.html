        <p>This page describes the open source projects on 
        <a href=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~mrocklin>Matthew Rocklin's</a>
        github page. 
        <p> If you'd prefer you can just go directly to 
        <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin>the standad github page</a>.
        <ul>
            <li> Projects started by me:
            <ul>
            <li> 
            <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/matrix-algebra/>
            Matrix Algebra in Maude</a>: 
            A tiny DSL for simplifying matrix expressions. It is written in the
            Maude system using rewrite rules. The eventual goal is to wrap the 
            complexity of using BLAS and LAPACK into an easily expressible
            mathematical language.
            <li> 
            <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/ape/>APE</a>: 
            Static scheduling of array operations onto heterogeneous hardware.
            Wraps an MPI layer around the Theano project. Uses tompkins (see
            below) for scheduling.
            <li>
            <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/tompkins/>tompkins</a>: 
            A scheduler for computations on heterogeneous architectures
            including dependencies between tasks (represented as a DAG),
            and communication times. It solves the problem using an integer
            linear programming method described in an article by Tompkins. This
            code attempts to translate his math into clear Python code.
            Section and equation numbers are included. Uses the pulp library to 
            describe the ILP. 
            <li> 
            <li> 
            <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/ShallowWater/>Shallow Water</a>: 
            A time dependent solver for the Shallow Water equations. This code
            uses numpy or Theano for low level computation. It was designed to
            demonstrate how mathematical solvers can be written clearly in a
            high-level language and use libraries for efficient low-level
            computation. 
            <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/mailFeed>mailFeed</a>:
            A simple Python library to automate the collection of e-mail from a
            remote server. 
            <li>
            <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/alettertofaye>alettertofaye</a>:
            A letter attempting to explain common sense internet security to a
            non computer-scientist. 
            </ul>
            <li> Projects to which I contribute
            <ul>
            <li> <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/sympy>SymPy</a>:
            A symbolic mathematics library within Python. Similar to
            Mathematica or Maple. I contribute to the statistics and linear
            algebra modules. 
            <li> <a href=http://github.com/mrocklin/theano>Theano</a>:
            A library that bridges the symbolics-numerics gap. They self-style
            themselves as a "Math Compiler." My contributions to this project
            so far are trivial. I list it here because it is important to the
            APE project.
